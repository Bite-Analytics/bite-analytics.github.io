# Power BI + Microsoft Fabric: A Unified Analytics Experience

*By Manpreet Ragi, Sr Consultant – Analytics Experience*

---

Microsoft Fabric is reshaping the analytics landscape—and Power BI is at the heart of this transformation. As organizations demand faster insights, tighter governance, and more seamless collaboration, Fabric delivers a unified platform that empowers data professionals and business users alike.

## 🚀 What Is Microsoft Fabric?

Microsoft Fabric is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data platform that unifies data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. Power BI is now deeply integrated into this ecosystem, enabling end-to-end workflows from raw data to decision-making—all in one place.

## 🔍 Key Capabilities Power BI Gains with Fabric

### 1. **OneLake: A Single Source of Truth**
Fabric introduces OneLake, a unified data lake that eliminates silos. Power BI can now directly access data from lakehouses, warehouses, and KQL databases—no duplication required.

### 2. **Direct Lake Mode**
This new mode allows Power BI to query data directly from OneLake, combining the speed of import mode with the freshness of DirectQuery. It’s ideal for real-time dashboards and large-scale models.

### 3. **Copilot + Data Activator**
Copilot now supports Fabric data agents, enabling natural language Q&A across datasets. Data Activator adds automation—triggering alerts and actions based on data changes.

### 4. **AI-Powered Notebooks**
Fabric notebooks bring AI into your data workflows. Use natural language to summarize, translate, or clean data—then visualize results in Power BI.

### 5. **Enterprise-Grade Governance**
Fabric centralizes governance with OneSecurity, applying Row-Level and Object-Level Security across your entire data estate—from lakehouse to report.

### 6. **Migration from Power BI Premium**
Organizations using Power BI Premium (P SKUs) are encouraged to migrate to Fabric SKUs (F SKUs), unlocking new capabilities while preserving existing investments.
