## Declutter Your Power BI Visuals with Dynamic TOPN

### Tired of over-crowded visuals that don’t say much?

One of the most common issues in Power BI reports is a **bar chart (or table) overflowing with category values** — sometimes dozens. Sure, the data is technically complete… but is it really helping the user focus?

Probably not.

When visuals are **too busy**, they lose clarity and purpose. That’s where **Dynamic TOPN** comes in.

---

### 🎯 What is Dynamic TOPN?

Instead of showing every single category, you can show only the **Top N performing values** — where **N is defined by the user**, using a slicer or dropdown.

For example:
- Show Top 5 Products by Sales
- Let users switch to Top 10, Top 20, or even All
- Keep visuals clean and focused — without hardcoding the logic

- A **parameter table** for the user-defined N value
- A simple but powerful **DAX measure** to apply the ranking dynamically

### 🔍 Why Use Dynamic TOPN?

Here’s why it works:
- ✅ **Improves performance** by reducing the number of rendered elements
- ✅ **Enhances user control** with adjustable granularity
- ✅ **Tells a clearer story** — focused on what matters

---

### ✅ Pro Tips

- Pair with **field parameters** to let users choose between metrics (e.g., Sales, Profit, Quantity)
- Use **tooltips or drillthroughs** to dig deeper into items outside the Top N
- Add a **line chart** below to track trends of the selected Top N over time

### 💬 Final Thoughts

This small technique can drastically improve the **readability and flexibility** of your Power BI reports. It's one of those underrated tricks that feels small but has a huge impact.

If you’ve tried something similar — or want to explore **Bottom N** or **Top N by different metrics** — drop a comment or reach out. I’d love to hear how you’re using this in your own work!
